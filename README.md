Sentiment Analyzer is an NLP project designed to analyze and categorize user-generated text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a sentiment analysis model on a diverse dataset of user reviews. Once trained, the model can automatically predict the sentiment expressed in new text, making it a valuable tool for businesses to understand customer feedback, monitor social media sentiment, and derive actionable insights from large volumes of textual data.
